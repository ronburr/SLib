This is a C++ library of various utilities that I have developed over
a while.  They are core components that I use in a lot of my primary
software development.  They probably duplicate features and functionality
in many other existing libraries, but I either didn't know of the other
libraries at the time I added a component here, or I thought the other
library was just too large to get just the one component or feature that
I was looking for.

Hence this library.

The code compiles fine on Linux, MS Windows (using the borland free compiler),
and AIX.  I haven't tested it on any other platforms, but I actively use
it on the first three mentioned.

All of the code in this library is copyrighted by me (Steven M. Cherry
<smc@cherrys.org>) but available to anyone to use under the terms of the
GNU LGPL.  You can find a copy of the LGPL in this source archive as 
the file COPYING.

Building:

For any of the above platforms, simply cd into src, and do:
make -f Makefile.platform

This will generate a shared object, or DLL and place it in the lib
directory with all includes going into the include directory.  If you 
would like the library or includes to be located somewhere else, you
are welcome to move them anywhere you want.

For new platforms, start with the closest makefile to your platform
and change as necessary.  You'll also probably have to make changes
at least to Thread, Lock, Socket, SSocket, and perhaps others to get
things to actually work.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, drop me a note.
